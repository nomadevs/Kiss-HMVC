# CONTRIBUTE
If you'd like to contribute please get in touch with me. I'd appreciate the help and any coding tips you have. I'm always trying to improve my programming skills and still learning. If you do want to contribute (I'll get around to creating a **Dev** branch for this) please code with a similar style to mine and also try to make your code simple enough that I and others can understand. The goal behind my framework is to help others learning to code themselves and for people wanting to try and roll out their own frameworks if they want. Lastly, I don't have regular access to the internet so the best way at the moment to contact me is to email me at <philosaphylas@gmail.com> or through my website <https://mywebfolio.me/>, thanks!
