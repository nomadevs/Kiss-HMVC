# CONTRIBUTE
If you'd like to contribute please get in touch with me. I'd appreciate the help and coding tips you might have. I'm always trying to improve my programming skills. If you do want to contribute to my framework make a pull request and please code with a similar style to mine. Try to make your code simple enough for me and others to understand. I don't always have regular access to the internet so the best way to contact me is by email: <philosaphylas@gmail.com> or through my website <https://mywebfolio.me/>.
