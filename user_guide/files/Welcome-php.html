 <div class="CTitle">Welcome to KissHMVC</div>
 <div class="CBody"><p>KissHMVC (CodeIgniter's illegitimate lovechild) is modeled after the CodeIgniter framework which I personally love. If you're just starting to learn PHP <a href="https://codeigniter.com" target="_top">CodeIgniter</a> is a great framework to begin with. It's simple to understand and isn't bloated like many other frameworks. KissHMVC follows the same philosophy! It's a compilation of code from around the web, studying how it worked, ALOT of trial &amp; error, and this is the result. If you trust my code feel free to use it but make sure to keep all licenses and copyrights intact if you plan to use or make derivatives of it. If you decide to use my framework to modify and create your own, please let me know so I can mention you on my website, thanks! You can also look through my code if you're worried about security and make any changes as necessary to secure it yourself because I'm still in the beginning stages of developing the framework. It should be simple enough to understand. I believe code should be simple enough to understand in case you come back to it years later but also for new coders that are still learning themselves.</p><p>But anyways, like any framework there could be vulnerabilities and I'm not claiming to be a PHP expert. You've been warned! I'm also not entirely sure how well this framework will hold up to massive applications. It will be interesting to hear back from some of you that have attempted. The great thing about my framework is that it's the best of both worlds. You can use normal <a href="../index.html#File:Terminology.php:MVC_vs.HMVC" target="_top" onmouseover="NDContentPage.OnLinkMouseOver(event,7);" onmouseout="NDContentPage.OnLinkMouseOut(event);" >MVC</a> which has the added bonus of loading Controllers unlike CodeIgniter which only lets you load Models and Views. Or, you have the option to use Modules ( another feature CI doesn't offer straight out of the box ) to organize your application.</p><p>If you're familiar with CodeIgniter then KissHMVC will be easy to learn. I'm not trying to compete with other frameworks although that may be a possibility in the future depending on any contributers that would like to help me make that a reality and also my ability to make progress on it myself. I'd also like to make a side note that there's a framework coming out at the end of 2019 called Trongate by a YouTuber I follow which will also have similar syntax to CodeIgniter and also make use of Modules. So if you like CodeIgniter and Modules then you will also want to check that out and especially since that will be much safer to use than my framework at the moment.</p><p>Furthermore, I've also been looking at CodeIgniter's core classes and getting a general idea of how it works and then creating similar code but not as complex because some of it is beyond my head. I started this project several months ago and then recently began working on it again. I rewrote the code and created a better file structure following the design pattern CodeIgniter uses including a tutorial I found that also uses a similar pattern. This framework was meant to teach myself and also help others learning how to assemble a framework from scratch. This project wasn't meant to become a legitimate framework, however, it has slowly started become just that! It's far from complete but it's a great start. I still need to address security concerns, complete library classes, helpers, etc. If you would like to contribute, offer coding tips, or use my code feel free to do so. And keep checking back often for updates as I continue to make progress!</p></div>
