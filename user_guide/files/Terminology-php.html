 <div class="CBody"><p>View partials are as they sound, they're partial view (e.g. you can think of header and footer files as view partials) files that you load in to main view files. Which is especially useful if you're using modules to create widgets.</p><div class="CHeading">See Also</div><p><a href="../index.html#File:Terminology.php:Widgets" target="_top" onmouseover="NDContentPage.OnLinkMouseOver(event,6);" onmouseout="NDContentPage.OnLinkMouseOut(event);" >Widgets</a></p></div>

 <div class="CTitle">Widgets</div>
 <div class="CBody"><p>Modules are often used to create so-called Widgets making use of view partials to load in to other view files that may belong to another module or controller. Sometimes as an application evolves and grows it may be necessary to create additional features. And widgets allow you to do this quickly instead of sifting through thousands of lines of code to tweak things. The distinction between Modules and Widgets is small but you can think of Modules as one of many parts that make up the sum of the application and a Widget is only one or more smaller parts that are add-ons to an application but the application is not dependent on them, where as, if you remove a Module it may affect how the application runs.</p><div class="CHeading">See Also</div><p><a href="../index.html#File:Terminology.php:View_Partials" target="_top" onmouseover="NDContentPage.OnLinkMouseOver(event,5);" onmouseout="NDContentPage.OnLinkMouseOut(event);" >View Partials</a></p></div>

 <div class="CTitle">MVC vs. HMVC</div>
 <div class="CBody"><p><b>MVC</b> stands for Model-View-Controller. In programming, people have cleverly created patterns to organize their code and/or applications. It's a great way of staying organized. Not only this, but this way of separating code allows developers to more easily work with designers (this will make sense soon).</p><table class="CDefinitionList"><tr><td class="CDLEntry">Models</td><td class="CDLDefinition"><p>are php files that communicate with databases to gather data using queries (a database is just a way of storing information for later access).</p></td></tr><tr><td class="CDLEntry">Views</td><td class="CDLDefinition"><p>are php files we put all our content (e.g. html, css, images) which is what is viewed by the public. As mentioned previously, designers mainly work with these files which is why this type of organization makes it possible to collaborate with others that may not have programming experience.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="CDLEntry">Controllers</td><td class="CDLDefinition"><p>are php files that control (as the name implies) everything. For instance, if we need to grab data from the database we would simply call the model in the controller and then display or send that data to a view file for the public to see.</p></td></tr></table><p><b>HMVC</b> stands for Hierarchical-Model-View-Controller. HMVC is similar to normal MVC except that it allows you to have multiple triads that communicate with each other in a sort of hierarchy, hence the acronym. HMVC allows you to have more modular code and allows you to organize your code in to folders called <b>Modules</b>. This allows us to more easily reuse our code in other applications. For example, instead of sifting through files for snippets of code (like looking for a needle in a haystack <b>php pun</b>) we can simply copy a folder of files and tweak things a bit instead of reinventing the wheel. You can think of a module as a smaller application.</p></div>

<a name="PHP"></a><a name="Topic8"></a><div class="CTopic TInformation LPHP">
 <div class="CTitle">PHP</div>
 <div class="CBody"><p><b>PHP</b> stands for Pre-processor-Hypertext-PHP. Kind of a redundant acronym but it used to stand for Personal-Home-Page and was originally created as a Templating system which evolved in to a legitimate web programming language despite the fact that it's technically a server-side scripting language. If you break down each word you can get sort of an idea of what PHP is. PHP takes web text (i.e. <a href="../index.html#File:Terminology.php:Hypertext" target="_top" onmouseover="NDContentPage.OnLinkMouseOver(event,9);" onmouseout="NDContentPage.OnLinkMouseOut(event);" >hypertext</a>) and dynamically pre-processes it (i.e. it does something with the text before displaying it to screen). For instance, a static (i.e. text rarely changes) site displays text that you manually have to edit every now and again. Which means if you have to change something that may mean having to manually change things across the entire website. Where as, PHP allows you to change something in one location and it will dynamically change things across the whole website which saves a lot of time.</p></div>

<a name="Versioning"></a><a name="Topic18"></a><div class="CTopic TInformation LPHP last">
 <div class="CTitle">Versioning</div>
 <div class="CBody"><p>E.g. <b>1.0.0</b></p><p>Incremental changes made to an application. A unique 3-digit number is used to identify the type of release and what changes were made.</p><p>The first digit is the <b>major</b> number and is for major changes or releases to an application; this could mean a total rewrite of core functionality that could affect large percentage of your users.</p><p>The second digit is the <b>minor</b> number and is for minor changes or releases to an application that may affect a smaller number of users; Also, newer functionality could be added in this release.</p><p>The third digit is the <b>patch</b> number and is for bug fixes and isn't as likely to affect your users as much.</p><p>Before releasing your application you can start at version alpha or beta. Beta is where your software is mostly finished but still needs work but you release your code for testers to give you feedback and if they find bugs it helps you improve your code before your actual release. Alpha is when your code not ready for release and is still being written and at this stage it's not ready for the public to test out. Many programmers will skip the first two steps and begin at version 1.0.0 until their application is done and then start incrementing the version as they find bugs or make changes to their code.</p></div>
