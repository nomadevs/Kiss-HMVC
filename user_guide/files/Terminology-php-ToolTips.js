Sometimes as an application evolves and grows it may be necessary to create additional features. And widgets allow you to do this quickly instead of sifting through thousands of lines of code to tweak things. The distinction between Modules and Widgets is small but you can think of Modules as one of many parts that make up the sum of the application and a Widget is only one or more smaller parts that are add-ons to an application but the application is not dependent on them, where as, if you remove a Module it may affect how the application runs.</div></div>",9:"<div class=\"NDToolTip TInformation LPHP\"><div class=\"TTSummary\">All online text that you see visually on your computer screen; just a fancy name for web text or online text.</div></div>"});
