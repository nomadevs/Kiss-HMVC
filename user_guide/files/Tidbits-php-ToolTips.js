NDContentPage.OnToolTipsLoaded({8:"<div class=\"NDToolTip TInformation LPHP\"><div class=\"TTSummary\"><b>PHP</b> stands for Pre-processor-Hypertext-PHP. Kind of a redundant acronym but it used to stand for Personal-Home-Page and was originally created as a Templating system which evolved in to a legitimate web programming language despite the fact that it\'s technically a server-side scripting language. If you break down each word you can get sort of an idea of what PHP is. PHP takes web text (i.e. hypertext) and dynamically pre-processes it (i.e. it does something with the text before displaying it to screen). For instance, a static (i.e. text rarely changes) site displays text that you manually have to edit every now and again. Which means if you have to change something that may mean having to manually change things across the entire website. Where as, PHP allows you to change something in one location and it will dynamically change things across the whole website which saves a lot of time.</div></div>"});
