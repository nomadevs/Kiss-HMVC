The goal of my application is to design a framework with simple easy to understand code that works very similar to CodeIgniter but with fewer lines of code.</p><p>The other reason for creating this framework is to create something I can easily understand and maintain. CodeIgniter will eventually be moving on to version 4 which is a total rewrite of the framework. I happen to like it the way it is. So I'm slowly digging through their code and creating code I can understand and picking out parts to work in to my framework. Since my framework is based upon their framework I've credited them and included any licenses and copyrights as needed and also to help support them too.</p></div>
