NDSummary.OnToolTipsLoaded("File:Welcome.php",{20:"<div class=\"NDToolTip TInformation LPHP\"><div class=\"TTSummary\">KissHMVC (CodeIgniter\'s illegitimate lovechild) is modeled after the CodeIgniter framework which I personally love. If you\'re just starting to learn PHP CodeIgniter is a great framework to begin with. It\'s simple to understand and isn\'t bloated like many other frameworks. KissHMVC follows the same philosophy! It\'s a compilation of code from around the web, studying how it worked, ALOT of trial &amp; error, and this is the result. If you trust my code feel free to use it but make sure to keep all licenses and copyrights intact if you plan to use or make derivatives of it. If you decide to use my framework to modify and create your own, please let me know so I can mention you on my website, thanks! You can also look through my code if you\'re worried about security and make any changes as necessary to secure it yourself because I\'m still in the beginning stages of developing the framework. It should be simple enough to understand. I believe code should be simple enough to understand in case you come back to it years later but also for new coders that are still learning themselves.</div></div>",30:"<div class=\"NDToolTip TInformation LPHP\"><div class=\"TTSummary\">The MIT License (MIT)</div></div>"});
