Reason being, I had a misconception of what I thought programming was at the time. For example, we\'ve all accidentally opened up a file with a program that didn\'t recognize the file type and a bunch of gibberish would appear on the screen that was impossible to decipher. I had a similar occurrence and thought that must be what programming was, boy was I was wrong! Now, years later, I find myself loving programming! Funny, how life has a way of throwing curve balls, isn\'t it?</div></div>"});
