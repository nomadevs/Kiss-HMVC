 <div class="CTitle">Programming: Connecting The Dots</div>
 <div class="CBody"><p>When I was younger, I can remember saying that I'll never be a programmer because it seemed so complicated to even bother. Reason being, I had a misconception of what I thought programming was at the time. For example, we've all accidentally opened up a file with a program that didn't recognize the file type and a bunch of gibberish would appear on the screen that was impossible to decipher. I had a similar occurrence and thought that must be what programming was, boy was I was wrong! Now, years later, I find myself loving programming! Funny, how life has a way of throwing curve balls, isn't it?</p><div class="CHeading">How Do I Learn To Program ?</div><p>One thing I found out as I was learning <a href="../index.html#File:Terminology.php:PHP" target="_top" onmouseover="NDContentPage.OnLinkMouseOver(event,8);" onmouseout="NDContentPage.OnLinkMouseOut(event);" >PHP</a> is that a lot of online tutorials will teach you PHP but they leave out one important step which is how to <b>problem solve</b> which is <b>80%</b> of programming. You can understand a programming language but not necessarily how to apply it in a practical way. Programming teaches you to think abstractly; sort of how an artist visualizes what they're painting. Some programmers think of code as poetry and in some ways it truly is a form of art. I like to think of web programming in two ways: when you write code it's sort of like you're creating virtual machines that you're putting together to solve a task -<b>or</b>- it's like you're drawing with code because you're creating functionality for a website to perform an action or effect to manipulate a design a web designer has created.</p><p>The way I learned to program is by studying other peoples code and reading or watching tutorials. I would stare at code for hours until I started to understand it. One thing you will find out in doing this is that you will start to notice patterns. And what I mean by this is you will see that multiple programmers will use similar ways to accomplish tasks; it just comes down to personal taste and efficiency. They will use common native (i.e. built-in) functions frequently. You will also find that people have multiple ways of achieving the same result. So there really is not a right or wrong way of doing things. Some of it is experimentation or trial and error which may result in an interesting piece of code that others may see and want to copy because they like your idea. And vice-versa, if you like the way someone else does something or their style of coding you can adopt it in to your own code. Over time you will start to develop your own style of doing things but this is gradual as you learn and feel more comfortable programming. Learning to program is almost like learning a human language, such as, Spanish. The better you get at it the easier it will be to read and understand as if you were reading a book in English. Here's a tip I heard recently (which I briefly mentioned above), which is the ability to sit for long periods of time and stare at code until you understand it or get it to work. Some people find it difficult to do this because of time constraints or the ability to focus for long periods of time. The video I watched recommended setting aside about 4 hours of time to code. I've also heard this from other programmers as well. According to this expert programmer this one important skill is <u>all</u> anyone needs to learn programming and I believe it because this is how I learned.</p></div>
